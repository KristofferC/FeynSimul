FeynSimul
========

v0.3 released 14-01-12

FeynSimul is a tool to use a GPU to do estimatations of ground state operator
means for bosonic quantum mechanical systems. The program uses a Monte Carlo method to do high dimensional integrals that arise from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.


FeynSimul was last developed 2 Jun 2014.
